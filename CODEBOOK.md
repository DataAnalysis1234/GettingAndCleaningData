Codebook - Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This codebook relates to the tidyData.txt file in this repository. The README.md file contains more information on the data set.

Aggregated by subject and activity, the tidyData.txt file has the average of all data points.

Identifiers:

1. subject- The ID of the test subject (30 subjects in total)
2. activity- the type of activity performed when the data was collected.

Activities:

The below data points were origionally numbered, but I transformed those data points into their proper names, which correspond to the numbers below. These are what the subject was doing when the test was performed.

1. WALKING

2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4. SITTING

5. STANDING

6. LAYING
